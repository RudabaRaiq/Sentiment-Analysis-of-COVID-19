# Sentiment-Analysis-of-COVID-19
To unveil the heartbeat of public emotions through the Sentiment Analysis Project exploring the highs and lows of sentiments in the age of COVID-19. As we navigate through the complexities of the COVID-19 pandemic, understanding its global impact is crucial.
As an identical ingredient of my Data Science internship with #OESON Private Ltd, this is my final project named “Sentiments Analysis” of the outbreak for COVID-19 diseases at #OGTIP #Oeson where I utilise Python to EDA-Exploratory Data Analysis, NLTK, and Sentiment Intensity Analysis.
The data-driven exploration aims to unveil the psychological toll, identifying regions where negative sentiments have significantly influenced mental health. Our goal is to empower proactive psychological care, enabling swift responses to potential outbreaks.
I want to express my gratitude to the team of #OESON for the chance and #Minakshi Gautam for her assistance with this project.
